# tic-tac-toe
Small game of tic tac toe for a presentation to display a small bit of what vue js is.

The game is really simple and showcases the use of VueX as a state manager to determine the current player. The code then also has a two dimentional array which portrays the game board, where if a player selects a title, that position will be updated in the game board. Checks on rows, columns, and diagonals for three in a row and display's the player who won.
